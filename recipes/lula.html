    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutton (or minced sheep and beef meat by 50:50)</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Sheep tail fat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Sumac</li>
        <li>Lavash</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The soft portion of the mutton is ground with onion using a meat grinder and mixed with pepper and salt. There should be 400 grams of onion in per 1 kilogram of minced meat. This ratio is followed, to make it stay on the skewer.</li>
        <li>The meat mash is mixed well and stored in a cold for an hour. Later the mince is extracted from the refrigerator and is mixed well.</li>
        <li>The mince is wrapped around the skewer. The mince gets slightly long form on a slightly wide skewer. Then it gets fried on coal barbecue, called a mangal. It's cooked for 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>The kebab is served between the lavash. Sprinkling sumac on it is optional.</li>
    </ol>
